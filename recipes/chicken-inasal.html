    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      
      <h4>Chicken and the Marinade</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken, with skin attached</li>
        <li>1 cup spiced vinegar</li>
        <li>1 2/3 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <l1>3/4 cup lemongrass, chopped</l1>
        <li>2 inch peeled ginger, sliced and crushed</li>
        <li>1 whole garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice or calamansi juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>For Basting</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup annatto oil or 1/4 cup olive oil mixed with 1 1/2 tsps annatto powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsps butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tsps salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsps lemon juice or calamansi juice</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>For the Dipping Sauce</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Spiced vinegar or mixture of spiced vinegar and soy sauce</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix the chicken and marinade ingredients in a large Pyrex bowl or a freezer bag, such as Ziploc. Massage the marinade into the chicken and cover the bowl with plastic wrap (or remove the air if using a Ziploc bag) and let marinate in the refrigerator overnight or at least 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients for the basting sauce in a separate bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat cast iron pan and add a little annatto oil. Take the chicken from the refrigerator and sear both sides on the pan on medium-high heat until browned, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>While searing the chicken, start preheating the oven to 400F. Transfer the chicken to a nonstick baking tray and bake for 40 minutes, until the thickest part is 165F inside. During the last 15 minutes, baste the chicken every 5 minutes.</l1>
        <li>Serve the chicken with rice and dipping sauce.</li>
      </ol>
